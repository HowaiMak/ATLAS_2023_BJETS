Monte-Carlo Simulation of high-energy paticle collision

## University of Glasgow Graduation Project (PHYS4022P)
### "Measureing b-quark structure at the LHC", Supervised by Dr. Andy Buckley
This project is dedicated to measure in-depth the bottom quark jet structures, where jets are defined as collimated sprays of hadrons produced from high-energy collisions. The analysis includes various key characteristics of these jets, including the N-Subjettiness, Les Houches Angularity, Energy Correlation Functions, C2 and D2 correlations and Lund Jet Planes. The primary source of the bottom quarks in this project will be coming from the decay pattern of the top and antitop quarks pair (ttbar). This is chosen specifically due to its distinct decay channel of b-jets plus dileptonic, which serves as a complex enough yet distinguishable experiment.

High energy collisions yield a significant quantity of light quarks (u, d, s quarks) and gluon jets, known as the background contamination. A key emphasis in this project lies in establishing solid selection criteria for identifying valid b-jets: A method often referred to as the "Tag and Probe" method. Through the evaluation of the efficiency and purity of these events, the objective is to compare with real data from ATLAS at LHC for the detection of b-quarks.
